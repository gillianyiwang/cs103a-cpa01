# CPA01 - Data Analysis of Global Power Plants
This project uses the [Global Power Plant Database](https://pages.github.com/) that contains data of power plants around the world. Here are some questions I've answered using the dataset:
· How many power plants does the US have?
· Which countries have the most power plants? What kinds of primary fuels do they use?
· Which countries have the highest total electrical generating capacity?
· What are the most common primary fuels around the world?
· Which power plants are in the high latitudes?
